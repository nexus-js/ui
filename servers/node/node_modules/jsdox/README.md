# jsdox.js

jsdox is a simple jsdoc 3 generator.  It pulls documentation tags based on a subset of [jsdoc 3](http://usejsdoc.org/) from your javascript files and generates [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files.

Relies on (for now) patched version of the UglifyJS parser to get the full AST including comments
